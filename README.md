# Futsal-ML-Agents

In `Assets/Scenes/`, we can find the different executable game environments:
* Striker vs Goal
* Striker vs Striker
* 2VS2
* 4VS4
* 5VS5

For each of them, default RL models are already applied, but in `Assets/TFModels/`we can find alternatives and old versions of them. In `Assets/YAML config files/`there are the relevant configuration files used and discussed in the [report](/report_images/report.pdf)
